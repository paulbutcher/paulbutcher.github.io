I am a technology start-up veteran, a consultant for start-ups and investors, and an author.

The senior technologist behind several successful start-ups, I have repeatedly driven the entrepreneurial process from business plan and prototyping through to execution and exit. I was Chief Software Architect of SwiftKey, subsequently acquired by Microsoft. I went on to co-found English Language iTutoring, subsequently acquired by Cambridge Assessment English, and am currently CTO of XLIO Ventures.

I am the author of [Seven Concurrency Models: When Threads Unravel](https://pragprog.com/titles/pb7con/seven-concurrency-models-in-seven-weeks/) and [Debug It!: Find, repair, and prevent bugs in your code](https://pragprog.com/titles/pbdp/debug-it/), both published by Pragmatic Bookshelf.

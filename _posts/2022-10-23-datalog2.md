This is part 2 of a series.

[Part 1](http://paulbutcher.com/blog/2022/datalog1/)

The code to accompany this series is available [here](https://github.com/paulbutcher/datalog-flix).

## Injecting facts

In part 1 of this series, we used Datalog rules to infer new facts about characters in Game of Thrones.

But where do our initial facts come from? In part 1 we simply typed them out as part of our Datalog, but this isn't a scalable approach. We don't want to type out all the details of all of the characters in Game of Thrones!

What's more likely is that we'll read these facts from some external source; perhaps a database or a JSON file. This is where the power of Flix integration comes into play; we can use Flix, a powerful general purpose language, to read our data and get it into the right format. We then *inject* it into Datalog facts.

So instead of writing this (from part 1):

```
def main(): Unit \ IO =
    let got = #{
        ParentOf("Tywin Lannister", "Cersei Lannister").
        ParentOf("Tywin Lannister", "Jaime Lannister").
        ParentOf("Cersei Lannister", "Joffrey Baratheon").
        ParentOf("Cersei Lannister", "Myrcella Baratheon").

        GrandparentOf(x, y) :- ParentOf(x, c), ParentOf(c, y).
    };
    let grandparents = query got select (x, y) from GrandparentOf(x, y);
    println(grandparents)
```
{: .language-flix }

We can instead write:

```
def main(): Unit \ IO =
    let parentList = ("Tywin Lannister", "Cersei Lannister") ::
        ("Tywin Lannister", "Jaime Lannister") ::
        ("Cersei Lannister", "Joffrey Baratheon") ::
        ("Cersei Lannister", "Myrcella Baratheon") :: Nil;

    let parents = inject parentList into ParentOf;

    let got = #{
        GrandparentOf(x, y) :- ParentOf(x, c), ParentOf(c, y).
    };
    let grandparents = query got, parents select (x, y) from GrandparentOf(x, y);
    println(grandparents)
```
{: .language-flix }

This is part 2 of a series. [[Part 1](http://paulbutcher.com/blog/2022/datalog1/)]

The code to accompany this series is available [here](https://github.com/paulbutcher/datalog-flix).

## Injecting facts

In part 1 of this series, we used Datalog rules to infer new facts about characters in Game of Thrones.

But where do our initial facts come from? In part 1 we simply included them as part of our Datalog, but this isn't a scalable approach. We don't want to have to manually re-enter all the details of all of the characters in Game of Thrones!

What's more likely is that we'll read these facts from some external source; perhaps a database or a JSON file. This is where the power of Flix integration comes into play; we can use Flix, a powerful general purpose language, to read our data and get it into the right format. We then *inject* it into Datalog facts.

So instead of writing this (from part 1):

```
def main(): Unit \ IO =
    let got = #{
        ParentOf("Tywin Lannister", "Cersei Lannister").
        ParentOf("Tywin Lannister", "Jaime Lannister").
        ParentOf("Cersei Lannister", "Joffrey Baratheon").
        ParentOf("Cersei Lannister", "Myrcella Baratheon").

        SiblingOf(x, y) :- ParentOf(p, x), ParentOf(p, y), if x != y.
    };
    let siblings = query got select (x, y) from SiblingOf(x, y);
    println(siblings)
```
{: .language-flix }

We can instead write:

```
def main(): Unit \ IO =
    let parentList = ("Tywin Lannister", "Cersei Lannister") ::
        ("Tywin Lannister", "Jaime Lannister") ::
        ("Cersei Lannister", "Joffrey Baratheon") ::
        ("Cersei Lannister", "Myrcella Baratheon") :: Nil;

    let parents = inject parentList into ParentOf;

    let got = #{
        SiblingOf(x, y) :- ParentOf(p, x), ParentOf(p, y), if x != y.
    };

    let siblings = query got, parents select (x, y) from SiblingOf(x, y);

    println(siblings)
```
{: .language-flix }

Or, more realistically, we read our data from some external file (in this case, Jeffrey Lancaster's amazingly detailed [Game of Thrones dataset](https://github.com/jeffreylancaster/game-of-thrones)):

```
def main(): Unit \ IO =

    let parents = inject Json.getParents() into ParentOf;

    let got = #{
        SiblingOf(x, y) :- ParentOf(p, x), ParentOf(p, y), if x != y.
    };

    let siblings = query got, parents select (x, y) from SiblingOf(x, y);

    println(siblings)
```
{: .language-flix }

Which gives us the following (truncated!) output:

```
(Aegon Targaryen, Jon Snow) :: (Aegon Targaryen, Rhaenys Targaryen) ::
(Arya Stark, Bran Stark) :: (Arya Stark, Rickon Stark) ::
(Arya Stark, Robb Stark) :: (Arya Stark, Sansa Stark) ::
(Benjen Stark, Brandon Stark) :: (Benjen Stark, Eddard Stark) :: ...
```
